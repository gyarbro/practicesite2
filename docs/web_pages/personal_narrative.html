	<h2> Let me tell you a little bit about myself...</h2>

	<p>Family is important to me, especially my husband and son.</p>
	<p>I am currently reading <i>Remarkably Bright Creatures</i> by Shelby Van Pelt. I cannot seem to put it down!</p>
	<p>I love the color red.</p>
	<p>I enjoy being in the sun and listening to the sounds of bodies of water, even the pool.</p>
	<p>If I could travel year round, I would in a heart beat.</p>
	<h3>What else can I tell you about myself?</h3>
	<p>Well, I prefer to read mystery, thriller, romance, memoirs, and gothic literature.</p>
	<p>I am excited to attend the Summer Curriculum Development starting on Monday, June 23rd.</p>
	<h4>You may be asking yourself...Why is Lupe excited to attend the Summer Curriculum Development?</h4>
	<p>Well, even you weren't asking yourself, I'm going to share with you why I'm excited. I am advising this year and cannot wait to see
	what our team will develop regarding one of my all time favorite texts, which is (i)Frankenstein(/i) by Mary Shelley.</p>
	<p>Needless to say, Shelley is my girl! I love reading <i>Frankenstein</i> because no matter how many times I read it, I always find an interesting
	new connection.</p>
	<h5>Ah, you wish me luck!</h5>
	<p>Well, thank you! I hope I do well and enjoy working with my team.</p>
	<h6>Tata, for now!
	<p>Please feel free to continue viewing the rest of my website.</p>

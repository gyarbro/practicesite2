	<h2> Let me tell you a little bit about myself...</h2>

	<p>Family is important to me, especially my husband and son.</p>
	<p>I am currently reading Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. I cannot seem to put it down!</p>
	<p>I love the color red.</p>
	<p>I enjoy being in the sun and listening to the sounds of bodies of water, even the pool.</p>
